# Read the entire data file into memory
raw_file <- readLines(con = "C:/Users/tbare/Documents/Skole/Koding/R Data/problem2galaxies.txt")

# Identify the line number L of the separator line
first_two_chars <- substr(x = raw_file, start = 1, stop = 2)
L <- which(first_two_chars == "--") %>% min()

# Save the variable descriptions in a text file
cat(raw_file[1:(L-2)], sep = "\n", file = "variable_descriptions.txt")

# Extract the variable names
variable_names <- raw_file[L-1] %>% 
  str_split(pattern = "\\|") %>% 
  unlist() %>% 
  str_trim()

  gsub(" ", "", .)

#Problem 3 -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Create a histogram to visualize the distribution of galaxy diameters
ggplot(galaxies, aes(x = a_26)) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 0.5, fill = "skyblue", color = "black") +
  labs(
    title = "Distribution of Galaxy Diameters",
    x = "Diameter (kpc) at Holmberg's isophote",
    y = "Frequency"
  ) +
  theme_minimal()



# Create a scatter plot of galaxy diameter vs. distance to showcase that the smaller galaxies indeed are underrepresented
ggplot(galaxies, aes(x = D, y = a_26)) +
  geom_point(alpha = 0.5) +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", col = "red", se = FALSE) +  # Adding a red trendline to showcase the trend in observations
  labs(
    title = "Galaxy Diameter vs Distance",
    x = "Distance (Mpc)",
    y = "Diameter (kpc) at Holmberg's isophote"
  ) +
  theme_minimal() +
  scale_y_log10()  # Applying log scale to y-axis to better visualize the data and size-disparity

# As we can see, the scatterplot is skewed to the upper right corner of the plot, indicating that the
# smaller objects are under represented in the sample. Intuitively, an overrepresentation of the 
# smaller objects in the sample would result in the opposite: a scatterplot with observations skewed to the
# bottom left of the plot.
# In other words, the plot indicated that there are fewer small galaxies (low KPC) detected at
# greater distances (high MPC), which aligns with the presented hypothesis (smaller galaxies might be underrepresented)

# One possible explanation of this might be due to the nature of the observations. It is reasonable to think that the smaller
# galaxies are fainter and therefore might be harder to detect at greater distances. This is just me thinking out loud though.
